# Howdy, I'm Serhii! 👋

## Lead Software Engineer based in Austin, TX

I build robust, scalable web applications as well as tiny tools to make life easier. I enjoy learning new technologies
and taking a larger scoped view to help design and architect systems.

Outside of software development work, I'm an avid social dancer.
