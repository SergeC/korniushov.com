          Howdy! I&#39;m <b>Serhii</b>, a <i>Lead Software Engineer</i> and open-source enthusiast from Dnipro, Ukraine, where I was born
          and raised.
        </p>

        <p>
          My programming journey began when I decided to help automate accounting tasks for my mother&#39;s work. While I
          naively jumped straight into coding without much preparation, this hands-on approach actually proved
          successful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&#39;ve always been fascinated by programming, even before I fully understood how computers worked. One of the
          most rewarding aspects of my journey has been learning to bridge that knowledge gap. The continuous sense of
          discovery keeps me passionate about this field.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I&#39;ve had the privilege of collaborating with product owners, C-suite executives, and
          fellow developers who have helped elevate my standards for software quality. These experiences have enabled me
          to create meaningful products that are not only user-friendly but also built with clean, maintainable code.
